# slack-bot
## Slack Integration
This bot was originally conceived as a helpful tool for AGILE teams to get sprint summaries and notifications of stale tickets sent directly to them through Slack. It is currently a work in progress, and it was a bit sidetracked with goofy features like randomized movie script creation and the occasional light jab at users. 

### Current Features
- Generates a random movie script by pulling a random selection of words and applying them to one of many templates available.
- Will occasionally insult/compliment a team member using a random combination of words.

### Planned Features
- JIRA integration to fetch sprint summaries
- GitHub integration to notify users when a PR has been opened or updated
